**Title**: 
- Resilient Federated Learning Framework

**Summary**:
- Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach to training machine learning models collaboratively across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. However, the performance and robustness of FL systems are heavily influenced by the underlying communication infrastructure. The proposed framework will incorporate mechanisms to gracefully handle the addition and removal of worker nodes, minimizing disruptions to the training process and maintaining model quality.
